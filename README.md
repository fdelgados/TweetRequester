# Tweet Requester

We need a small REST API with one endpoint that given a Twitter username, should return the user’s last 10 tweets, in JSON format.
 
 * Feel free to use any frameworks or libraries you need. 
 * If you want to use a framework, take into account that we use Symfony2.
 * The application should not save anything to MySQL or to any other relational DB.

## We will value:

 * Code tested with Behat and/or PHPUnit (or with any other testing tool).
 * The code's architecture and the paradigm usage like Hexagonal Architecture and DDD.


## Bonus:

 * Improve the application’s speed caching the response using Memcache(d), Redis or any other system you may know.
